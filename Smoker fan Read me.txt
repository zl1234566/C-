This cpp file runs on an arduino Mega (ATMEGA 2560). It is used to run a blower fan, temperature sensors and an LCD screen. It uses temperature sensors to make sure a charcoal barbecue grill heats up to cooking temperature quickly and lets you know what the temperature of your meat is so that it can be monitored for doneness. A cooking temperature is input using buttons that raise or lower the set point. When the grill temp is below the set point the fan will turn on to heat up the coals and raise the temperature. Once the set point is reached the fan turns off and the program continues to monitor the temp; if it drops below the set point the fan turns on to keep the grill at a fixed cooking temperature.
